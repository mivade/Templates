# Jinja/Bootstrap framework #

This repository contains a basic framework for quickly building web
applications with the [Jinja2][] template rendering engine (e.g., with
[Flask][]). Essentially, it contains all the stock files that I use
for everything to make it easier to get going on a new project.
